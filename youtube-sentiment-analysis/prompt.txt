# YouTube Top Comments Sentiment Analysis Project

## Project Overview
A web application for analyzing the sentiment of the most liked comments on YouTube videos based on a user-specified topic.

## Requirements

### Web Application Interface:
- Launch a web page with a central search window.
- User inputs the topic of interest in the search window (e.g., "sam altman fired").
- Display results including:
  - Title of the video.
  - Number of likes for each video.
  - Top 5 most relevant comments from each video.
  - Number of likes for each comment.
  - Sentiment analysis result for each comment (Positive, Neutral, Negative) from 3 models.
  - Displaying total number of positive, negative, and neutral ratings in the area under search.

### YouTube API Integration:
- Use the YouTube API to fetch the most popular videos related to the user-specified topic.
- Extract the top 5 most relevant comments from each video.
- Use the `order=relevance` parameter to get the most relevant comments.
- Handle potential issues gracefully:
  - Skip videos if unable to retrieve comments or likes.

### Sentiment Analysis:
- Utilize the sentiment analysis models:
  - `cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment` from the Hugging Face transformers library.
  - `siebert/sentiment-roberta-large-english`.
  - `sbcBI/sentiment_analysis_model`.
- Analyze each comment to determine the sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative).
- Under each comment, display the name of the model that evaluates it and its score.
